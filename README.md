Blockchain Developer Bootcamp final project - Simple Decentralized Exchange

## About
The purpose of this project is to create simple decentralized exchange allowing users to swap their tokens, borrow for lenders and lend from borrowers. Idea behind such a basic example is to write it very simple and understand core principles behind swaping, leding, borrowing and other defi actions. I am very interested in  DEX'es so it will be good start to contribute to DEX projects such as Airswap or Sushiswap.

## Example workflow

1. User identifies himself with Metamask wallet
2. User chooses token pair to echange with
3. Users submits exchange intent and allows for swap in Metamask
4. After successfull swap user gets confirmation message
