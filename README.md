Blockchain Developer Bootcamp final project - Simple Decentralized Exchange

## About
The purpose of this project is to create simple decentralized exchange allowing users to swap their tokens, borrow for lenders and lend from borrowers. Idea behind such a basic example is to write it very simple and understand core principles behind swaping, leding, borrowing and other defi actions. I am very interested in  DEX'es so it will be good start to contribute to DEX projects such as Airswap or Sushiswap.
